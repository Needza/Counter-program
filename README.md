# Counter-program
Simple program to count numbers.
Program has 3 commands:
Decrease: to decrease the number when we click the button Decrease;
Increase: to increase the number when we click the button Increase;
Reset: to reset the count to 0 (where it starts from) when we click the button Reset;
Got help and inspiration from YouTube channel called Bro Code to help me start with the coding for practise.
